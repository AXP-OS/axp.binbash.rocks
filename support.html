Most likely you ended up here because you tried to contact me personally with a support request.
<br/>
Of course there may be reasons to communicate with each other personally in private, but usually (and this is why you ended up here) it is rather counterproductive.
<br/>
<br/>
So <b>Why</b>?
<br/>
<br/>
Just imagine someone asking me the question:
<br/>
<i>How do I get into recovery mode?</i>
<br/>
I answer: <i>You have to do this and that.</i>
<br/>
<br/>
2 days later, another user writes me:
<br/>
<i>How do I get into the Recovery Mode?</i>
<br/>
I answer: <i>You have to do this and that.</i>
<br/>
<br/>
again a few days later:
<br/>
<i>How do I get into the Recovery Mode?</i>
<br/>
I answer: <i>You have to do this and that.</i>
<br/>
<br/>
Does this make sense to you? Likely not as it does not for me. That's why there are forums, where a question can be asked and answered once.
<br/>
This saves time and nerves, so please stop making private support requests to me and search the forum and if you don't find an answer: just open a new thread.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want you can send me the link to your thread via DM/PM but remember, I do this in my spare time so don't expect to get a guaranteed answer in a certain time.
<br/>
<br/>
One more thing: 
<br/>
If you have a problem, it is almost always helpful to add <b>pictures, screenshots and log files</b>.<br/>Often a <b>picture</b> says 1000 times more than a long description - even if giving a lot of details is always a good idea ;)
